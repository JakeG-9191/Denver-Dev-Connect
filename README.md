This is a full-stack MERN application that allows developers access to a new social media platform. Users can sign up, build profiles, interact with other users, write posts, add comments and remove their posts and comments.

Users can build a biography that highlights tech skills, academic and professional accomplishments and experience, in addition to connections with other social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc...) and thier 5 latest github repos.

The application uses MongoDB Atlas as its database, thus data persistence is provided.
